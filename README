This project is an all encompasing use of infrastrucutre as code.
My Goal was to be able to construct a Kubernetes structure from scratch in the most seamless way possible.

There are some manual steps that i needed to configure such as
  installing ansible
  connecting ansible to the other nodes in the cluster.

0. Github-CI should be able to build and run all that i need to deploy my infrastructure
1. Terraform will provision VMs in Azure and pass the correct information (IP address / ssh keys)
2. Ansible will provision the nodes to be setup and ready for kubernetes.
2.1. Ansible will install and deploy the cluster. Currently it is setup as 1 master node and 3 worker nodes. Adding workernodes to the cluster should be as simple as adding it in terraform and ansible (host file).
3. Kubernetes should then deploy the applications that I specify. (Currently only SnipeIT and IPAM. Grafana node to monitor the cluster is in progress)

4. Ideally if I wanted to destroy everything. I should be able to run the pipeline again and have everything back to up fresh again.


- Infra
  - Using terraform to create base infrastrucutre needed for the application
    - RDS database
    - Kubernetes cluster (VMs)
    - Image repository

- config
  - Use Ansible to deploy configuration for the master node and worker nodes / supporting servers
  - All these files pertain to setting up the kubernetes cluster or other supporting services

- Application
  - Kubernetes deployment scripts for different pods that need to run

- Containers
  - Dockerfiles that control the setup of the docker containers
